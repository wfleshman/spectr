{"input": "Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.\nBut last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.\nForestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.\nYou can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.\nAspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.\nThat's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.\nThe last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.\nSo Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!

Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.\n\"It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.\n\"They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.\"\nFrom former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.\nShe said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.\nBirmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.\nDet Sgt Ian Comfort said: \"This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.\n\"The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.\"\nSupt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were \"not sought lightly\" and the police, council and other groups had already made \"exhaustive efforts with these men\" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.\nOrganised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.\nBut today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.\nThe names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.\nChaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.\nThat shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.\nBut in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.\nEven in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.\nThe men made subject to the injunctions A summary is", "target": "Two rival criminal groups have been hit with what police describe as the largest ever gang injunction."}

They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth\u2019s rotation axis.\nWhen liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.\n\"Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,\" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.\n\"This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.\"\nAlthough the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.\nDr Livermore told BBC News: \"It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).\"\nThat the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.\nLaunched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth's magnetic field.\nWith their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field's various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.\nIt is  hoped the Swarm satellites\u2019 data could ultimately tell us why Earth\u2019s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.\nScientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.\nThis occurs every few hundred thousand years.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos A summary is", "target": "Scientists say they have identified a remarkable new feature in Earth\u2019s molten outer core."}

{"input": "Will he be less outspoken? Will he temper his Twitter tirades? Will he back down from his calls for a Muslim ban?\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nBut there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.\nHere are five.\nMr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.\n\"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,\" he posted on Facebook back in September. \"I am only working for the people of the US!\"\nEven though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.\nNow, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (\u00c2\u00a3307,850) per person.\nMr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.\nMr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.\n\"I don't have pollsters,\" he said last August. \"I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.\"\nIn fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.\n\"Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,\" he told the Associated Press.\nThat was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.\nAccurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.\nAt least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.\nLike many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.\n\"I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,\" he said in October. \"Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.\"\nPart of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.\n\"I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,\" he said in January. \"In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.\"\nThen Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.\nHis campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.\nThis, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents \"the natural maturation of the campaign\".\nOver the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment.

{"input": "At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.\nThough these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.\nTwo months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.\nThe proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's \"negativities\".\nSo would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.\nOf 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.\nAnd no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.\nFood for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.\nHere's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.\nIt was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.\nHere's how and when he has scored them.\nRooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.\nIf he can keep that up then who knows...\n... try, try again?\nWell doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.\nHarry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.\nHe's attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.\n\"Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.\"\nJudging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side's defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.\nIt was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?\nOn the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.\nA concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).\nHowever, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German's first at Anfield, while Saturday's result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.\nThe run of four clean sheets in Liverpool's final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.\nPossession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.\nThe Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger's side 'enjoyed' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.\nIt was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.\nClearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley's books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.\nJavier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.\nThe former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.\nIn fact, not one of Hernandez's 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England's top flight.\nHernandez's failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.\nAgainst Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you've guessed it, went wide.\nThe fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.\nLife just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.\nThe Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.\nIt means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.\nBut perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner's men continue to upset the odds. Huddersfield have named two of the four youngest starting XIs in the Premier League so far this season - and average age of 25 years and 143 days at Crystal Palace and 25 years 331 days against Newcastle.

{"input": "Twenty years ago today, Craig Brown's side faced England at Wembley at Euro 96 and encountered the kind of cruel fate that leaves a lasting regret.\nScotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. The performance overall was not bereft, which was in keeping with the tournament as a whole since Brown's team drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in the opening match and went on to defeat Switzerland 1-0.\nEven so, the game still stands out in the long history of encounters between the Auld Enemy, for its circumstances, its drama and, to an extent, its heartache.\nEngland needed to recover from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game that exacerbated the criticism of the players. Manager Terry Venables had taken the squad to Hong Kong prior to the tournament, where some were pictured out drinking heavily.\nDamage caused to the plane on the journey home brought further condemnation, while also building a siege mentality amongst the players and Venables, who had already announced he would be standing down after Euro 96 and would be succeeded by Glenn Hoddle.\nScotland were buoyed by holding the Dutch to a draw and although underdogs at Wembley, there was no sense of inferiority. Of the team that started the match, Colin Calderwood was at Tottenham, Colin Hendry had won the Premier League the year before with Blackburn (alongside England striker Alan Shearer), Gary McAllister was at Leeds and John Spencer was at Chelsea.\nThe rest of the team was made up of players from Aberdeen, Celtic and Rangers. For Scotland, naturally, the tie stirred memories of past excursions to Wembley and the fans mobilised en masse to London with a sense of living up to the zealous spirit of their predecessors.\nThe occasion worked with and against Scotland, though, since the England players were fired up by the historical significance of the game as much as the need to establish their worth at Euro 96. Before kick-off, England full-back Stuart Pearce could barely look at the Scots as they shook hands.\n\"You've got no friends when you play against a team like that,\" he later recalled.\nIt was a measure of Scotland's first-half performance that England used the interval to change their line-up. The game was still tied at 0-0, which suited Brown's side because the longer the game remained in the balance, the more doubt would enter the minds of the England players.\nVenables was too wily to be outfoxed, though. Recognising that his side was not dominating possession enough to threaten, he brought on midfielder Jamie Redknapp at half-time. Eight minutes into the second half, Redknapp was involved in the move that resulted in Gary Neville crossing for Shearer to open the scoring with a header.\nScotland were not subdued by the goal, and Gordon Durie's header forced David Seaman to desperately claw the ball away.\nDurie was involved in the next key moment, when he reached Stuart McCall's cross ahead of Tony Adams and was knocked over by the Arsenal defender's sliding challenge.\nMcAllister placed the ball on the spot, but as he ran to take his penalty kick, the ball rolled slightly. It was enough of a movement for Seaman to notice it and briefly wonder if the Scotland midfielder would stop and restart his run.\nInstead, he struck the ball firmly but relatively straight, and Seaman blocked the spot-kick. McAllister later insisted that the movement of the ball was not an excuse for missing, but also insisted that if he had scored, he was convinced Scotland's momentum would have driven them to victory.\nInstead, there was only further pain. Within 90 seconds the ball was worked out towards Paul Gascoigne, who lobbed it over Hendry then caught it on the volley to score past his Rangers team-mate, Andy Goram.\n\"You've got to hold your hand up at times and say it was a great piece of skill,\" Hendry later recalled.\nGascoigne ran to the byline and lay on his back while England players sprayed water into his mouth, mimicking the dentist's chair drinking game that had been caught on camera in Hong Kong.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe midfielder was typically mercurial, since it was his birthday the England players had been out celebrating in Hong Kong. He had been quiet in the opening match, too, and the Scotland bench were convinced Venables was about to replace him before he scored.\nThe England boss understood Gascoigne better than most, though, having worked with him at Tottenham as well.\nThe night before the Scotland game, Gascogine couldn't sleep and visited Venables in his hotel room. He confessed to being worried that he would not be selected for the game, and Venables told him he wouldn't be.\nEven with the player in tears, Venables left him thinking that for 45 minutes, before telling him he was playing and to get off to bed to sleep.\nSome of the Scotland players left the pitch feeling they had let their country down, while for many of the England players it was relief that underpinned their joy.\nThey went on to defeat the Netherlands 4-1, but Patrick Kluivert's consolation goal for the Dutch 12 minutes before the end meant Scotland were knocked out on goals scored, despite both countries finishing on four points and with a goal difference of minus one.\nEngland reached the semi-final, only to lose to Germany on penalties. Their defeat was overseen by Berti Vogts, who led his country to the title, and then six years later became manager of Scotland.

{"input": "One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year.\nThe other was the Economist. The magazine, that is.\nTheir bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff.\nThe country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade.\nThe more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018.\n\"China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,\" says Prof Pettis.\n\"In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.\"\nOther examples include the Brazilian economic \"miracle\" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a \"lost decade\" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation.\nWhat these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training.\n\"You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,\" he explains. \"And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable.\n\"But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.\"\nChina has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years.\n\"A lot of growth is fake,\" he says. \"If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output] today whether or not anyone actually uses the airport.\n\"If no-one uses it, however, the economic value created by the airport is not enough to repay the debt, and so future growth must decline as wealth is transferred from some other part of the economy to pay down the debt.\"\nHe says that there are three main sources of growth for China. The first, investment, is already exhausted. The second, exports, are also no longer viable, as China's main export markets in Europe and the US are depressed, and China's trade surplus has become politically contentious in those countries.\nThe third option is for ordinary Chinese people to increase their spending on consumer products and services.\nBut here the numbers just don't stack up. Consumers account for just a third of spending in China - an unprecedentedly low share for any major economy - while investment accounts for a whopping half of the economy.\nIf investment just stagnates - and in developed capitalist economies it usually falls after such a long boom - then, with consumer spending starting from such a low base, China would have to pull off the biggest consumer spending boom in history just to maintain overall economic growth at the planned rate of 7%-8%.\nBut the kinds of policies that would be needed to pull this off - such as paying Chinese households more interest on their savings, paying Chinese workers higher wages at the cost of state-owned company profits, or providing Chinese migrant workers with decent social benefits - run up against powerful politically-connected interests.\nProf Pettis is doubtful that it can be done.\n\"The bet's still on,\" says Simon Cox, Asia economics editor at the Economist. \"Though it won't be resolved till the end of the decade.\"\nThe Economist's side of the bet - that China will overtake the US by 2018 - was the default scenario in an interactive forecaster that they stuck on their website to let readers play God with the Chinese economy.\n\"[2018] seems quite soon, but then you look at the individual assumptions, and they don't seem too whacky.\"\nOne crucial assumption is the exchange rate. Mr Cox's team expects the yuan to strengthen against the dollar, even while prices rise more quickly in China, meaning that measured in dollars China's economy could still grow very rapidly, even if in reality the country actually slows down.\n\"I agree with Pettis on a whole range of things. I think the investment rate is too high, and it is difficult to invest wisely when you are doing it so fast. A lot of investment, especially by state-owned companies, is inefficient.\"\nWhere he parts company with the Beijing-based professor is on the question of whether China is running out of decent investment opportunities.\nChina is still a very underdeveloped country, and he says the capital stock per worker - the quantity of buildings, machinery, infrastructure, vehicles and suchlike relative to the population size - is still very low by Western or Japanese standards.\nHe also says that while Prof Pettis is focused on where spending will come from, what really matters for long-term growth is China's ability to improve skills and adopt new technology.\nWill China fall flat on its face?\nChina's economic miracle\nChina businessmen's stories\n\"China is very good at absorbing knowhow from the rest of the world. It is much more open to foreign investment than Korea and Japan were. And it has a large domestic market, so foreign producers have an incentive to tutor local suppliers in their products.\"\nMr Cox confesses to being an old-school Keynesian. As such, he believes that even if - as Prof Pettis believes - China does run into the same problem as the West, that ordinary citizens are not increasing their spending fast enough, the government can cope.\n\"If the alternative is unemployment, it is better to employ people to do something, even if it is not very value-adding.\n\"Lots of people are still living in old housing units left over from the 1990s, so it would be worthwhile employing people to build replacements for those.

He added that Britain was \"not part of Saudi-led operations\" in Yemen.\nBut it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's \"bunch of migrants\" comment.\nMr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.\nThe Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.\nMr Cameron replied: \"The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.\n\"Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.\n\"They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.\n\"They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.\n\"The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers.\"\nSeveral Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's \"bunch of migrants\" comments on Twitter, describing them as \"shameful\" and \"inflammatory\" and the PM as \"odious\".\nA Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase \"demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep\".\nYvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use \"much more statesmanship-like\" language on such a \"complex and sensitive\" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.\nShe got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order\nShe asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to \"withdraw\" the comment.\nMr Bercow told Ms Cooper: \"You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.\n\"I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously.\"\nHe ruled that it was not \"disorderly\" or \"un-Parliamentary\" but added \"people will make their own assessments of this matter\".\nThe prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent \u00c2\u00a31.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would \"open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais\".\nAsked if he considered the phrase \"bunch of migrants\" to be pejorative the spokesman said \"the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right\".\nMr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the \"bunch of migrants\" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.\nBut this was dismissed as \"silly and playing cheap politics\" by small business minister Anna Soubry\nShe told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the \"language of ordinary people\", adding \"we all use slang\" in the heat of the moment.\nDavid Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.\nMr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a \"major success\" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a \"step forward\", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it \"derisory\".\nMr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was \"0%\".\nMr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.\n\"Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st,\" he said.\n\"They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.\n\"Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?\"'\nMr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.\nFirstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a \"victory\" and a \"major success\". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.\nSecondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.\nThirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.\nHMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.\nBut few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.\nMr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a \"striking\" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.\nDowning Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.\n\"It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come,\" Mr Cameron said.\n\"It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity.\"\nThe SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.\nHe called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).\nMr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at \u00c2\u00a3155 a week would end discrimination because \"so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.\n\"The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe,\" he said.\nHe urged Mr Cameron to \"welcome in and provide a home\" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.\nIn response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been \"more generous\" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.

It is not simply a matter of duplicating what you do in the United States and plopping it into another city.\n\"Two, you need to understand what it is you are trying to get out of the programme.

{"input": "The proposals are the brain child of Swiss businessman turned politician Thomas Minder, who runs a small family company producing natural cosmetics.\nMr Minder wants shareholders to have a veto over managers' salaries, and to ban golden handshakes altogether.\nThe \"fat cat initiative\", as it has come to be called, would, if approved, be written into the Swiss constitution, and would apply to all Swiss companies listed on Switzerland's stock exchange.\nMr Minder, an outspoken man, says the culture of high salaries and high bonuses in Switzerland has got out of hand, pointing to the fact that huge sums have been paid out even when the companies concerned were doing badly.\nThe bankruptcy of national icon Swissair back in 2001, and the subsequent huge payoffs to its failed boss Mario Corti, were the catalyst to Mr Minder's decision to act.\n\"That really stuck in my throat,\" he told Swiss television. \"It made me absolutely furious.\n\"I'm still furious today, to think that a chief executive like Mr Corti could get five years' salary to go. I mean, the company was in a disastrous situation. At the end he wasn't even paying its bills. Swissair went bankrupt. The company doesn't exist anymore.\"\nSalaries for Swiss top managers are higher than most and their taxes are lower.\nThese two things alone would not necessarily anger most voters, however.\nWhat has attracted support for Mr Minder's initiative has been a series of perceived disasters for major Swiss companies, coupled with salaries and bonuses staying high.\nThe main example is banking giant UBS, which wrote off billions in the wake of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, and then had to be bailed out by the Swiss government.\nAfter that, the bank lost more billions because of a rogue trader, and announced thousands of redundancies.\nBut high salaries and bonuses for the bank's top managers continued throughout.\n\"The fat cats are getting fattest in the banks,\" says Edouard Dommen of the Swiss shareholders group Actares.\n\"The other companies are getting fat, but not quite so grossly.\"\nMr Dommen, who supports the new measures, believes voters are especially angry about UBS, because their own tax money had to be spent to bail out the bank.\n\"People are fed up,\" he says. \"They know that this is at their expense.\n\"Small people had to dig into their own pockets to bail out these banks, and then see people, some of whom turned out to be literally crooks, walk off with their money, so of course they are angry.\"\nIf passed, the measures would give Switzerland some of the strictest laws on executive pay in the world, far tougher than the limit on bonuses just approved by the European Union.\nBoth the Swiss government and Swiss business leaders have been campaigning against the measures.\nThe government says it understands that voters want some control over high salaries and has offered a milder alternative, but so far this seems to have attracted little interest.\nMeanwhile the Swiss Business Association has been arguing that the measures would undermine Switzerland's ability to compete.\n\"Certainly, it will damage our competitiveness,\" says the association's deputy head of competition and regulation, Meinrad Vetter. \"We are against this initiative because it violates Switzerland as a business location.\n\"It's not good if the corporation law is too strict and too rigid in comparison to other countries, and with this initiative we will be an island in corporate governance all over the world.\"\nBusiness leaders have argued that some of Switzerland's biggest companies might simply leave, if they were unable to attract top quality managers because they were not allowed to pay them what they wanted.\nFor the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, such a move might actually be quite easy.\nThe company's current headquarters is in Basel, within sight of both the German and French borders.\nConcerns over loss of competitiveness, and fears that Swiss companies might emigrate, did at first seem to be striking a chord with voters.\nBut one event, caused ironically by Novartis itself, seems to have changed a lot of minds.\nIn February of this year it was announced that Novartis' outgoing chairman Daniel Vasella would be receiving a 72m Swiss francs (\u00c2\u00a351m; $78m) \"non-compete\" pay off over six years, designed to stop him working for other related industries.\nThere was amazement and anger in Switzerland. Mr Vasella's salary had been regarded by many as excessively high for some time. Meanwhile, Novartis had been cutting jobs.\n\"I thought this was absolutely astonishing,\" says Mr Dommen, a man who doesn't mince his words.\n\"He is an idiot. I say he's an idiot because given this vote is coming up, to do something so grossly provocative at that moment just guaranteed that the opposition was going to win.\"\nThe payment was scrapped in response to protests.\nAnd indeed, the latest opinion polls seem to reflect that, showing that 64% of voters will say yes to the \"fat cat initiative\".\nMr Dommen does not believe a yes vote will isolate Switzerland.\nInstead, he says, it would bring his country into line with public opinion across Europe.\n\"Times are changing throughout Europe,\" he says.\n\"The period when people could get away with these enormous salaries is going out of fashion.\n\"In Switzerland we are not on a different planet - it's going out of fashion here too.

Belotti, 23, remains in Serie A, where he scored 23 goals last season.\nReach, tone and risk\nFragile fan base\nNumbers\nIs he worth 100m euros?\nDespite the benefits to be gained from monitoring it, social media can give players an outlet to project themselves as something they are not.\nThat becomes harder when they cross the white line on match day.\nGeir Jordet, professor in sport psychology at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, works with several top clubs across Europe - including in the UK.\n\"The best way to learn about about the psychology of a player is to observe what he does on the pitch,\" he says.\nJordet has devised a model of 11 attributes that can be used to judge whether a player will succeed, or can be helped to succeed, at the very highest levels.\nAmong the things he advises clubs to do are watch a player immediately after they make a mistake, see how they communicate with team-mates and assess to what extent the player is proactively involved in the game.\n\"I have built up a research portfolio on observing players' body language in matches, and I help clubs to see that,\" he says.\nJordet says clubs must also ensure any new player must fit in with the \"coaching culture\".\n\"The heavy training culture at one club, for example, might be a very powerful part of their recipe for success, and they might be especially keen to sign a player who fits into that - someone like Romelu Lukaku, for example.\n\"But there might be other clubs who would be willing to take more of a risk on a player who does not seem to be as dedicated, because they are good at dealing with so-called problem players, those who might be easily distracted by life off the pitch.\"\nTo put it simply - everyone is different. Two individually brilliant footballers may not play well together.\nJesse de Preter, a director at Atticus Sports Management, says everyone involved in the talent-spotting process is thinking more than ever about the personality of players.\nBut he still regards it as an \"underdeveloped part\" of the business.\nDe Preter said: \"In the UK clubs it is a permanent search for talent, and many have specialists who are involved in the psychology of targets.\n\"The scouting departments, even at many of the Championship clubs, are full of people, full of TV screens, they have the most expensive software available, staff travelling constantly around the world. It is an extensive system, backed by a lot of money.\n\"Footballers are very highly paid employees, but for some reason we still think everyone should be treated in the same way. That is the same as saying: 'OK, it is physical training today, everyone runs five miles together.'\n\"You can see the proof every year. When a brilliant player goes for a lot of money somewhere, and does not do well, the player is blamed, the coach is blamed.\n\"Then, when the player goes away to another environment and becomes a star, everyone says 'oh it was too early for him', when there will be many other factors why it didn't work out, completely linked to his personality; the way he functions in a group, or the other people in a group.\"\nSo where does this fit in with the traditional methods used by scouts?\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is now an 'independent advisor' to clubs but he used to work as a scout across Europe. He believes that the \"expertise of psychologists is a useful addition to the scouting process\".\nHowever, he also makes the point that the traditional role of scout - if done well - has always involved \"studying players in a social context\".\nThis could include observing behaviour in training, a player's standing within the group dynamic in social situations, such as at a team hotel, or their reaction to the media.\nHe says: \"In our environment, you have seen so much of a player before you sign him - in training, in matches, interviews - and you have spoken to people that you trust, like previous coaches and other people in the football world. Usually the total of all that information is deemed to be sufficient to make a call on a player.\n\"If you look at a player like Kylian Mbappe, you know that he has come through the French elite national academy at Clairefontaine, then the Monaco academy, so already you know he has gone through an excellent school with really high standards. That would make you comfortable about signing him.\n\"Football always involves an element of risk. I don't think even the most skilled psychologist in the world could project with great accuracy where a player is going to end up. But of course it makes sense to involve such professionals, and there are clues to be found in his behaviour on the pitch, in his reputation, in his development.\"\nDe Preter describes the increasing focus on personality as a \"new trend\".\nAnd while former Tottenham and Liverpool director Damien Comolli says clubs have \"always checked players' backgrounds extensively\" he acknowledges the game is changing.\nHe says people are beginning to \"look more at the individual as a human being before as a football player\", a trend he describes as \"one of the main current topics in recruitment\".\n\"High-level sport is so demanding,\" he adds. \"If we get the wrong individual in on day one, that can destroy everything the club is trying to achieve.\n\"When I was at Tottenham we were thinking about a massive investment on a striker who was playing abroad. I travelled to meet him, and in our conversation I asked him why he would like to join Tottenham.\n\"His reply was: 'Well, I would like to live in London, because there I can have a quiet life with my girlfriend without everyone recognising me in the street.'\n\"I left that meeting feeling very uncomfortable. He never told me he wanted to win, he never told me he wanted to help the club or help himself improve.\n\"This is what clubs are trying to understand before they sign players, and now I think everyone is pretty much talking about the same thing: getting the right person in as well as the right player.\n\"It is a trend that is not going to stop evolving, and we are only at the beginning.\" A summary is", "target": "Will a \u00a3300,000-a-week salary change a hot prospect's attitude to the game?"}

{"input": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nA winner must be declared on the night - as an ice hockey rink needs to be laid at midnight for a match at the same Hallenstadion venue the following day.\nBut what else do you need to know?\nBBC Radio 5 live's sports news correspondent Richard Conway explains.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFifa's 209 nations will gather in Zurich for what is billed as an \"extraordinary congress\".\nIt was called after Sepp Blatter dramatically announced last June that he would step aside after 18 years as Fifa president.\nThe 79-year-old Swiss said he was \"laying down his mandate\", which has led to some concern he may not have actually resigned.\nHowever, Fifa officials are confident he will not make an awkward re-appearance - not least because he has been banned from football for eight years over a \"disloyal payment\" of \u00a31.3m to suspended Uefa president Michel Platini.\nBoth men deny wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans.\nBlatter also has no accreditation to get into the conference hall on the outskirts of Zurich where the congress is being held.\nThere are two big issues to settle.\nFirst, the FA representatives have to agree to a package of reforms designed to eliminate the problems that have plunged Fifa into crisis in recent months and restore its reputation.\nThen, if and when that is formalised, they have to appoint a new president.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGiven the hype and spin around the election the reforms have been slightly forgotten about - but they are vitally important to the organisation's future.\nOne Fifa insider believes it would be a \"disaster\" if measures to clean up the governing body fail.\nSpecifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries.\nResponsibility for everyday business decisions will be removed from the \"political\" representatives of national associations.\nThe \"executive committee\" will be disbanded. In its place will come a new 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women, to set global strategy.\nThe day-to-day running of Fifa will pass to a new \"general secretariat\" - equivalent to a corporate executive board - and the secretary general, effectively the CEO, will be a powerful position.\nThe checks and balances will be carried out by a series of committees, the most important of which will be the fully independent audit and compliance committee.\nFifa wants the regional confederations and national associations to mirror their efforts over time and they will place immediate new demands on them, such as annual audits.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nYou would think so given Fifa's recent history. However, officials aren't taking any chances.\nThe proposals need 75% approval to be passed.\nActing president Issa Hayatou has been very active in spreading the message about the need to adopt the raft of proposals.\nHayatou was censured by the International Olympic Committee for his part in the ISL scandal - where the sports marketing company paid $100m (\u00a366.2m) to officials, including former Fifa president Joao Havelange and ex-Fifa executive Ricardo Teixeira, in return for lucrative television and marketing rights throughout the 1990s.\nAdditionally, he has been accused of taking a $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) bribe from Qatar to vote in favour of their bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Both he and Qatar categorically deny any wrongdoing.\nSo it is of interest that Hayatou has been at the forefront of the reform efforts.\nHayatou has an unassailable reputation (although not in Europe) amongst large sections of the 209 Fifa nations, despite his alleged wrongdoing. His voice carries weight amongst the \"family\" and the vote should therefore be carried without any issues.\nFifa is still in a perilous position with ongoing American and Swiss investigations into the activities of current and former officials.\nAs it stands, the organisation is considered a \"victim\" by the US Department of Justice. But that could change.\nIf the DoJ believes Fifa is not reforming or is carrying on as usual then it could be charged under US racketeering laws designed initially to tackle organised crime.\nPassing the reforms are therefore vital if Fifa is to continue operating and not be shut down.\nYes. This is where it gets complicated.\nThe DoJ and the Swiss authorities are very interested in how the Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cups were awarded and if any wrongdoing took place.\nIf Fifa were to be shut down it could render the contracts for both those tournaments null and void.\nGeopolitically that could cause huge friction, especially given the delicate military situation in Syria at the moment.\nIn addition, the US is a big ally of Qatar and has a strategic air base there.\nGiven all of this, many question whether there is the political will from President Barack Obama's administration to carry out the ultimate threat. One insider said recently he believes there is pressure on Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, not to act in this regard.\nFar from it.\nIn December, when the US made its second wave of arrests, it issued a superseding indictment.\nThere are 24 unnamed co-conspirators within the document, including high ranking Fifa officials and members of national FAs. Some may be cooperating with the US already, others not.\nAt some stage the US will have to act and a grand jury has been sitting in the US to consider ongoing matters.\nIn addition, the Swiss investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding process is ongoing. That enquiry has widened and has resulted in Blatter being criminally investigated.\nBig question. No one knows right now.\nIf they do take action, the effect that has on the election will depend largely on who is targeted and where. The US is believed to be diverting its attention away from America and more towards Europe, Asia and Africa.\nIt is hard to see the mechanism by which the election could be stopped - but this is Fifa, so let's not rule anything in or out just yet.\nSheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain is still the front runner according to many observers.\nHe has the backing of his own Asian confederation and Africa, though the continents do not vote as a bloc and the ballot is held in secret.\nHowever, such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated.\nThe national associations do not want to back the loser either\u2026 even though the vote is secret. There may be big swings in the vote between the rounds.\nFifa presidency: Meet Sepp Blatter's five possible successors\nWhat about GianniInfantino?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Uefa general secretary Infantino has, according to the 45-year-old Swiss' camp, made gains in recent weeks. They believe he is the man to beat.\nWell, yes\u2026 but this is the same PR team behind Prince Ali bin al-Hussein's failed election attempt last May.\nBack then they made very different noises in the build-up, briefing that 40-year-old Jordanian Prince Ali was unlikely to win but would give Blatter a bloody nose.\nSo their bullish confidence with Infantino should not be underestimated.\nInfantino has strong support in Europe, South America and significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean.\nThey also think they will get half the votes in Africa. If that proves true then it's game over. He wins. \"If\" is the key word though.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPrince Ali lost the support of Europe for this election when Platini announced he was standing.\nHe failed to make gains after the 60-year-old former France captain was banned and Infantino stepped into his shoes.\nA safe prediction for Prince Ali would be that he has between 20 and 30 pledges of support.\nThat means he simply cannot win - but he could be a significant player in deciding the eventual victor if he drops out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate.\nFrenchman Jerome Champagne will stay on to the bitter end but is highly unlikely to get more than 10 votes.\nSouth African businessman Tokyo Sexwale's efforts have been something of a mystery and he has been criticised for running a lacklustre campaign.\nHe went on a joint visit to Robben Island, where he was a political prisoner, with Infantino on Monday.\nDespite that he says he will not quit. He seems to be playing a longer game - perhaps with his eye on a new Fifa if the current organisation is ever abolished.\nThere are 207 eligible voters, with Kuwait and Indonesia currently barred from taking part.\nThat may change on Friday and the total number of voters will be announced before the ballot.\nIn the first round, the winner needs two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that then a simple majority (105 in a 209-nation contest) is all that is required to win.\nIf there is still no winner then a third round will take place and the candidate with the fewest votes in round two would drop out at this point.\nThe candidates will each have 15 minutes to address Friday's congress, which is due to start at about 12:00 GMT.\nIn theory, the first round of voting should start at approximately 13:30 GMT.\nFifa estimates each round of voting will take one hour and 40 minutes.

{"input": "Physicists hope it could lead to discoveries that could potentially represent the biggest revolution in physics since Einstein's theories of relativity.\nAmong them is Prof Jordan Nash from Imperial College London, who is working on the CMS experiment at the LHC.\n\"We are opening a new window on the Universe and looking forward to seeing what's there,\" he said.\n\"As much as we have a lot of theories of what might be out there we don't know. We'd love to find something completely unexpected and we might, and that's the exciting bit.\"\nThey want a glimpse into a world never seen before. By smashing atoms harder than they have been smashed before physicists hope to peel back another veil of reality.\nThe aim of the various theories of physics is to explain how the Universe was formed and how the bits that make it up work.\nOne of the most successful of these theories is called the \"Standard Model\".\nIt explains how the world of the very, very small works.\nJust as the world became very strange when Alice shrunk after drinking a potion in the children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, physicists have found things are quite different when they study the goings on at scales that are even smaller than the size of an atom.\nBy doubling the energy of the LHC, it will enable them to discover new characters in the wonderful and mysterious tale of how the Universe works and came to be.\nThe Standard Model describes how the basic building blocks that make up atoms and the forces of nature interact.\nAnd just as in Alice's stories it features some eccentric characters, notably a family of 17 elementary particles.\nSome are familiar from school physics lessons, household names if you like.\nOne of the best known in the sub-atomic world is perhaps the electron, which orbits the atom and is involved in electricity and magnetism.\nAnother flashy A-lister is the photon, which is a particle of light.\nBut most particles from the Standard Model family are more niche, a little more art house if you like, and have strange names.\nIn fact, one of them is actually called \"the strange quark\".\nAnd others from this group of particles are named as if by thoughtless and unimaginative parents: \"up\", \"down\", \"top\" and \"bottom\" though \"charm\" does sound a little more, well, charming.\nA couple of these combine in various ways to form protons and neutrons, which along with electrons make up atoms from which the world is made. These are all members of a group called \"fermions\".\nAnd there is another group called the \"bosons\", that quite literally hold the place together.\nThey are called the \"force carriers\" in physics text books and give rise to the forces of nature: electrical, magnetic and nuclear forces, which pull other particles together or push them apart.\nWith the discovery of the sub-atomic world's biggest celeb of all, the Higgs boson, scientists have now detected all the particles predicted by the Standard Model: a theory that beautifully explains how the Universe works in intricate detail.\nOr so scientists thought.\nIt is incomplete. For a long time physicists thought that their Standard Model theory could explain almost everything.\nThen came two phenomena that showed that it explained hardly anything.\nFirst was the observation that galaxies are rotating much more quickly than they should.\nThe faster a galaxy rotates the more material it contains.\nThe observations suggested that they contain five times more material than could be detected.\nThis invisible material has been called \"dark matter\" which physicists believe accounts for a quarter of the Universe.\nSecond was the observation that galaxies were accelerating apart from each other driven by an even more mysterious force that the researchers who discovered it called \"dark energy\".\nSo all in all the Standard Model, brilliant though it is at explaining how our tiny corner of the cosmos works can't account for how the remaining 95% of the Universe works.\nEven then, of the 5% it is good for it can't explain gravity.\nAnd, just as the erstwhile poster child of physics slinks off to find a place to curl up and quietly weep, comes the biggest humiliation of all: it can't explain why the Universe exists at all.\nShortly after the Big Bang there were equal amounts of matter, from which all the atoms, stars and planets are made and anti-matter.\nMoments later the two should have cancelled each other out, as ripples sometimes do when meeting in a pond, to create a gigantic blast of energy and then, nothing but light.\nOur very existence demonstrates that clearly this did not happen.\nYou might have thought that this was bad news for physics - but actually physicists such as Prof Nash couldn't be more excited.\n\"It's our biggest opportunity in a generation to find out what's the next step, where do we go from here and how do we explain the things we don't understand about the composition of the Universe.\"\nThat is what physicists are hoping for. With the Large Hadron Collider set to double its energy, physicists hope that they will discovery weirder and even more wonderful particles that will point the way to a new more complete theory of sub-atomic physics.\nIn other words a sequel, with new even more bizarre characters and with no doubt some twists and turns in the plot.\nBook two has the working title of: \"Beyond the Standard Model\".\nScientists hope to find evidence of the invisible \"stuff\" called dark matter: the unseen Cheshire Cat behind the grin of the visible Universe we see around us.\nThere are lots of different theories for what the cat might look like.\nAmong them is an idea called supersymmetry or \"Susy\" for short.\nThis idea predicts new particles that are invisible partners of the ones we know already about.\nOne of these could be dark matter.\nAnother idea is that dark matter could be explained by the wonderfully evocatively named \"dark sector\".\nThis comprises shadowy new particles that don't obey the same forces as everything else but cannot easily be detected. They might be the invisible culprits that have been making our galaxies rotate faster than they should.\nResearchers will also be looking to find particles that are manifestations of extra-dimensions that we cannot detect but are predicted in some theories that extend the Standard Model to incorporate gravity.\nAnd the LHCb experiment will be studying the differences between matter and anti-matter in unprecedented detail.\nWho knows, but possibly one of the biggest changes in thinking in physics for 100 years.\nResearchers, such as Prof Tara Shears of Liverpool University who is working on the LHCb experiment hope to have their first taste of so-called \"new physics: a set of discoveries that will radically transform the theories of physics and our knowledge of how the Universe works.\n\"If I could have just one outcome form the next run of the LHC this would be it,\" she explained with a far away look in her eyes.\n\"It would be to make a discovery so unexpected that it doesn't fit with any of our theories, something that would show us that we have been on the wrong track in our efforts to understand the way that the forces of nature work, the way that matter is composed, something that will knock our heads sideways to make us come from a new direction.\n\"And that would be the paradigm shift and that shift, in my dreams would lead us to a much deeper understanding of the Universe.\n\"It would be wonderful if we could make a head start that would point us in the right direction.\"\nThe sub-atomic world is set to become \"curiouser and curiouser\".\nFollow Pallab on Twitter A summary is", "target": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been restarted after a two-year shutdown."}

{"input": "This time last year rugby club Wasps was putting the final touches to its move from High Wycombe to Coventry, a 75 mile journey it hoped would transform it from a club losing more than \u00a33m a year into a thriving leisure business.\nAs part of its relocation Wasps did not just move into, but acquired, the Ricoh Arena stadium complex in the West Midlands city for \u00a320m.\nThe fact that the Barbadian artist - famous for hit singles like Umbrella, We Found Love, and Diamonds - is kicking off her high-profile tour in their stadium is a source of pride to club executives, and an indication of how far financially as well as geographically they have come.\nIt also illustrates how the Premiership club sees its new commercial model as being as much about leisure as it is about sport.\n\"The entertainment side is where we see the biggest commercial growth,\" Wasps Group chief executive David Armstrong tells me.\nIt was 13 months ago that Wasps, then based in Buckinghamshire, announced they would play their home games at the Ricoh Arena, completing the stadium purchase a month later. Their first game as owners of their new home was a win against London Irish in December 2014.\nA year on, the club is no longer the tenant of Wycombe Wanderers football club, but a multi-venue, multi-use business.\nMoving a major sporting \"franchise\" lock, stock and barrel from one city to another is not uncommon in the United States, but in the more conservative UK, such uprooting is greeted with suspicion.\n\"The primary reason for moving was commercial,\" Mr Armstrong said, speaking to the BBC at the annual Rugby Expo conference at Twickenham.\n\"We were looking to create a stable long-term business model that would take us forward over the next 250 years,\" he adds, referring to the length of their Ricoh lease.\n\"With our previous business model, we were losing in the region of \u00a33m to \u00a34m a year. Our only revenue then was ticket sales. Food and beverage sales went to the football club, while other revenue went to our sponsors.\n\"We were a shell of a club, and couldn't be competitive and make money.\"\nAs well as its new income strands, earlier this year, the club raised \u00a335m with the issue of a seven-year bond, paying a fixed gross rate of interest of 6.50% a year until 2022 . Funds raised were used to restructure the club balance sheet and pay down existing debt, including loans acquired with the Ricoh Arena.\nAccording to Mr Armstrong the banks backed the bond issue because of the strength of the club's various income strands.\nOwnership of the Ricoh Stadium complex gives Wasps control over other income streams, not just from rugby matches.\nAs well as the main sports stadium bowl, the purchase also saw the club acquire the indoor 12,000-standing-capacity Jaguar Exhibition Hall, which hosts smaller music concerts, and can also be hired for trade shows, company presentations and other business use.\nAnd the Ricoh also contains three restaurants, five bars, 20 retail units, one of the biggest casinos in England, and a 121 bed hotel. Meanwhile, football club Coventry City football club, currently top of League One, are paying tenants.\n\"We are now a full end-to-end leisure brand, hosting conferences, banqueting, concerts, but headed by the rugby club,\" says Mr Armstrong.\n\"The important thing is that the other income strands give financial stability to the rugby team, they wrap around it.\"\nHe said that before the club moved it carried out thorough research, which showed an appetite within the West Midlands region, home to about five million people, for top-flight rugby .\n\"So we knew there was a potential fan base before we arrived in the area,\" Mr Armstrong says. \"The West Midlands, although it has a strong rugby union heritage, has never had a Premiership club.\"\nHe adds: \"In addition, we were looking at what we thought was the ultimate stadium for rugby union.\n\"It is not too big, not Manchester United-sized.  It is a 32,000 capacity, where crowds of 19,000 and 20,000 look comfortable. And it is also the right size for us to grow into as we extend our fan base.\"\nAnd the club, which currently sits eighth in the Premiership table after four games, has further expansion plans.\nSchemes in the pipeline include building a new training centre in the next year or two in the Coventry area, a second or even third hotel at the Ricoh complex, and a new 150,000 sq ft \"multi-use leisure facility with retail, and food and beverage\".\nThere are also plans for an expanded Wasps rugby retail business in the West Midlands.\nMeanwhile, the club says it also wants to provide a \"compelling digital offer\" not only for its rugby fans at the stadium (such as ordering food and drinks from your seat), but also for its other business customers who use the Ricoh facilities.\n\"But we never lose sight of what we are,\" he adds. \"We are a leading Premiership rugby club, and that will always be the heart of what do.\n\"The revenue we make means we can invest in training centres, coaches, physios, players and salaries, to give ourselves the best possible chance on the pitch.\"\nDominic Hayes, commercial director of Premiership Rugby observes:  \"I think the work that Wasps have done to up sticks and move city is a testament to the strength of the Wasps brand.  We have got to acknowledge there is some real strength there.\n\"Similarly with the Wasps bond, that was on the strength of the Wasps brand, not the Ricoh.\"\nAnd, while other famous music acts have played in the main Ricoh Arena bowl in the past before Wasps took over, Mr Armstrong is particularly pleased at the Rihanna news.\n\"For us it is important to get these big names... and it's nice to give a poke in the eye to Birmingham,\" he laughs.

{"input": "Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks.\nThey made access to popular websites, such as Reddit, Twitter, Spotify and many other sites, intermittent.\nSecurity experts said easy-to-guess default passwords, used on Xiongmai webcams, aided the hijacking.\nThe web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely.\nIn a statement, Hangzhou Xiongmai said hackers were able to take over the cameras because users had not changed the devices' default passwords.\nXiongmai rejected suggestions that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks.\n\"Security issues are a problem facing all mankind,\" it said. \"Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too.\"\nIt has also pledged to improve the way it uses passwords on its products and will send customers a software patch to harden devices against attack.\nThe recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.\nYes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.\nBefore the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.\nFor the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.\nAnd because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.\nNot easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.\nThere is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.\nAlso, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.\nBecause security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.\nDespite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.\nRight now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.\nIn one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.

{"input": "Nigel Farage is wondering why, as Jonathan Portes has been pointing out, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures for migration to the UK from other EU countries is so much lower than the number of National Insurance numbers allocated to EU nationals.\nAccording to the most recent comparable statistics, migration to the UK from the rest of the EU was 257,000 in the year to September 2015, but during the same period, 655,000 EU nationals registered for National Insurance numbers (Ninos).\nMr Farage smells a rat: \"They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Ninos are a simple and clear reflection of the real numbers of people in this country, as without them you can neither legally work, nor claim benefits.\"\nNow the government has promised to tell us how many of the Ninos issued are still active - in other words, how many of the EU citizens who registered are currently paying UK tax or claiming benefits.\nBut are Ninos a good measure of immigration?\nThere is no question that the official immigration figures, based on a survey taken at ports and airports, are imprecise, with the ONS 95% confident that the immigration figure is within plus or minus 23,000 of the true figure.\nMore importantly, though, the ONS figures only aim to measure long-term migration. They use the UN's definition of a long-term migrant as someone who moves country for a year or more.\nWhen it comes to National Insurance numbers, on the other hand, there is no minimum stay in the UK. Everyone who wants to work in the UK must have a National Insurance number, even if they're only working in the country for a few weeks.\nWhat's more, Ninos are unique to an individual, so once you've received one, it's yours forever. This means that not all those who HMRC reveal to be \"active\" will necessarily belong to people who have been in the country continuously since their number was issued - they could have left and returned.\nThe ONS statistics also include people who are not planning to work or claim benefits, such as children or non-working partners. These people don't need a Nino when they arrive, but can apply for one in the future. This means someone registering for a Nino could have arrived at any time, not necessarily in the year or quarter in question.\nIt's not hard to see how the two sets of figures would be different. The question is, should they vary this much, or is there a problem with the way the ONS currently gathers its data? HMRC has said it will work with the ONS to help reconcile all available sources of statistics, including Ninos, to ensure the figures are as accurate as possible.\nWith this process rumbling on - and the latest immigration and Nino statistics due out on 26 May - this issue is sure to keep providing fuel for the EU debate, coming just a month before the referendum.\nReality Check verdict: There are good reasons why the two numbers would be different, but they are strikingly far apart, and next month's figures showing how many of the numbers are active should help reconcile the two.\nREAD MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate A summary is", "target": "Campaigners to leave the European Union have been badgering the government about the reliability of the official immigration statistics."}

{"input": "These colourful lizards can scamper rapidly up walls, scuttle along ceilings and even hang upside down on polished glass.\nYet the secret of their amazing climbing ability remained a mystery until relatively recently.\nThe underside of a gecko's foot looks like a tyre tread and is covered in millions of microscopic hairs. Each hair splits into hundreds of tips just 200 billionths of a metre wide.\nThe secret of this lizard's adhesion turns out to be the relatively weak intermolecular forces that draw materials together any time they get close.\nThese van der Waals forces nevertheless explain how a gecko can support its own body weight on just one finger, and a single gecko hair can lift the weight of an ant.\nTo un-stick, the gecko pulls its foot away at a different angle.\n\"What we're talking about is something that is about as sticky as sticky tape - it's not crazy glue,\" says Prof Kellar Autumn, who became intrigued by gecko adhesion after being funded to develop climbing robots by the US military.\nProf Autumn, from Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, added: \"What is special about it is that it is controllable. And its controllability is based on geometry and physics, not chemistry.\"\nThe effort to uncover the mechanisms behind gecko climbing has already yielded synthetic material that sticks in the same way.\nStick, peel and re-stick a piece of existing adhesive tape several times and it quickly loses its clingy properties.\nProf Autumn and Mark Cutkosky, from Stanford University, compared natural and polymer-based synthetic gecko hairs using a machine that simulated gecko climbing. This showed both versions could be re-used some 30,000 times without losing their stickiness.\nSynthetic adhesives could yield transformative applications in robotics, industry, medicine, sports and clothing.\nBut one possible use always comes up in any popular discussion: could they allow humans to scale walls like Spider-Man?\nIn 2007, physicist and engineer Nicola Pugno, from Turin Polytechnic in Italy, calculated that a person wearing gloves and boots made of carbon nanotubes and structured to mimic gecko feet could indeed cling safely to a wall or a ceiling.\nChallenges would include wear and tear and the propensity for dirt particles to collect and inhibit stickiness.\nThe suit would have to work on every kind of surface and for long periods of time. But Prof Pugno says: \"We are not very far, in my opinion, from a kind of Spider-Man suit.\"\nProf Metin Sitti, from Carnegie Mellon University, says the idea is \"not impossible\". Selecting a lightweight person and applying the adhesive to many parts of the suit (not just the feet and hands) would improve the chances of success, he explains.\nBut, he comments: \"We get questions like: 'Can you carry a one-tonne weight'. And we say: 'Maybe, but that's not our biggest advantage'.\"\nA. The toes of geckos are covered in ridge-like lamellae, producing a tyre tread pattern\nB. Millions of microscopic hairs, or setae, cover each toe. These are only as long as two diameters of a human hair\nC. Each seta ends in up to 1000 even tinier tips, called spatulae\nD. The spatular tips are only 200 billionths of a metre wide -below the wavelength of visible light\nSeveral institutes have been developing robots that can climb walls - Stanford University's \"Sticky-bot\" can be seen in action here. Some scientists envisage \"geckobots\" being used to search for survivors in a burning building or disaster zone, to explore the rocky terrain of Mars, or even as toys.\nBut many in the field are most excited by more routine applications.\nMedicine is one target area for these adhesives. They could spawn advanced bandages that can be removed easily after healing or gripping surfaces on instruments designed for delicate surgery. Since the mechanism works in the wet, it could be used to affix implants within the body.\nStanislav Gorb, from the University of Kiel, studies biological adhesion; his work also looks at the way beetles stick to surfaces.\nHe says gecko material has several advantages when compared with generic sticky tape. There is no \"visco-elastic\" adhesive to dry out, so it stays attached for longer and leaves no residue.\nBut he says that with current production methods, they are unlikely to replace classical sticky tape.\n\"Maybe in 5-10 years we will have a method that will make the tape very cheap - right now it isn't. Secondly, right now, the forces are in the range or even lower than traditional sticky tape.\"\nZip it up\nMetin Sitti thinks gecko material could provide alternatives to current \"closure\" technologies, such as hook and loop fastening, zips and sealing systems on food packaging.\nIt is one area he is exploring through his company NanoGripTech, set up to commercialise his lab's gecko work.\nSynthetic adhesives work best on glass; rough or uneven surfaces pose more of an obstacle. Getting high performance out of gecko material on a variety of surfaces and in different conditions represents the firm's first challenge.\n\"We have been focusing on what happens when the surface gets wet, oily, dirty and what happens when temperatures change from very cold to very hot,\" says Prof Sitti.\n\"The second challenge is how can you manufacture and sell this [material] at high volume and at low cost?\"\nProf Sitti is working on this problem and expects within a year to begin manufacturing at low volumes.\nA silicone-based bio-inspired adhesive made by German firm Binder has been on the market for some six months. Prof Gorb was involved with its development.\nThe company has been exploring medical applications and the \"pick and place\" technology used in clean rooms to precisely position components on to circuit boards.\n\"Clean rooms often work with suction systems. That generates dust and requires a lot of energy, which contributes to the cost,\" says Jan Tuma, managing director of Binder.\n\"We are only sticky on really flat, shiny surfaces.

{"input": "At first sight, with billions in subsidies, you might think that every farmer would automatically want to keep the cash flowing and therefore choose to stay in.\nBut it's not so simple.\nIn 2014, the most recent year with confirmed figures, UK farms received \u00c2\u00a33.19bn. The average payment was \u00c2\u00a317,735. The highest was almost \u00c2\u00a32m.\nFor many farmers, particularly those working marginal land such as hills with poor soil, the subsidies act as a lifeline.\nMark Williams runs a farm perched on steep slopes near Welshpool in Wales with a spectacular view over the Severn Valley.\nSitting on his quad bike, a flock of sheep grazing nearby, he describes the payments as essential to keep communities like his going.\nHe says hill farming is very difficult and that the margins on beef and sheep alone are very tight, \"so the subsidy is very important to protect those farms\".\nBut travel the short distance from the Welsh uplands to the rich soils of Shropshire near Telford and you hear a very different story.\nBruce Udale and his daughter Isabel Moseley, who grow animal feed on their 1,200 acres, are both determined to leave the EU.\nThis is farming on an industrial scale, with huge fields and impressive machinery. We watch a giant tractor extend two vast arms to spray a bright green crop of wheat.\nThe farm attracts tens of thousands of pounds in CAP payments, but Bruce and Isabel are convinced that British farmers would be better off without them.\nIn their view, the subsidies swirling through the agricultural economy artificially inflate prices which means - according to Bruce - that the payments are not worth as much as they sound.\n\"If we don't have subsidies\", he says, \"I believe our costs would come down. Land values would probably come down, rents would certainly come down, machinery costs would come down because a lot of these things are priced at what the market thinks we've got in our pockets.\n\"So the loss would not be as great as many people think.\"\nAnd, because the payments come from the EU via the UK government, there is notorious bureaucracy. Isabel says it's hugely time-consuming and she resents it.\n\"For our children's future we should take things back in hand, make our own rules and regulations in Great Britain for our benefit.\n\"Now we have Brussels making our decisions. Yes, we have a slight input, but we can't change anyone's minds.\"\nOn his hill farm, Mark Williams has an answer to that.\n\"If they think there's going to be any less regulation, the UK is not going to revoke sheep tagging, they're not going to revoke the licences, they're not going to revoke the burial of livestock.\n\"We're still going to have to put up with all of that.\"\nWhat about access to markets? Of the UK's agricultural exports, just over 63% went to the EU with about 36% going to the rest of the world.\nMark says that makes the EU a crucial outlet.\n\"Over 90% of British beef and lamb ends up in the EU. With such a high number, to mess about with that could have big consequences.\"\nBut Bruce Udale argues that if the UK did withdraw, trade with Europe would not be over.\n\"With everything except sheep, we import more than we export, so I don't have too many worries that the EU would want to do a reasonable deal with us.\"\nAnother hot topic is labour. About 24,000 farm workers have come from the rest of the EU and at harvest-time the most labour-intensive farms - cultivating fruit and veg - require far more.\nThere are no exact numbers but some estimates suggest that around 60,000, mainly East Europeans, come for the summer.\nHidden behind tall hedgerows near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire is Eric Drummond's fruit farm, where as many as 350 Bulgarians and Romanians work at breakneck speed, picking strawberries in huge plastic polytunnels.\nWithout EU membership, he fears that the supply would simply dry up and paralyse production.\n\"It's a huge risk to your business, to any horticultural business. The whole industry relies on this labour coming into the country. So we are personally in favour of staying in because there's no word on what happens if we come out.\"\nBut like every point in this debate, there's a counter-argument.\nBruce Udale says there could be a scheme, similar to one that operated in recent years, where foreign workers could be brought in for a temporary period.\n\"I say tick them in, know where they're going, tick them out when they've finished. We can't have them just coming and going.\"\nFarmers themselves are probably too small in number to make much of a difference in the vote, but their sector of the economy is hugely important.\nNot only does the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) command the largest share of the EU budget, but also the farms themselves provide much of the food we eat.\nAnd how that work is carried out, and how it's organised, shapes the landscape itself.
